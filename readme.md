# Phaser

Phaser is a simple game I made with my daughter to help us learn [Phaser](https://phaser.io).

Your mission is to survive the asteroids until the timer runs out. Shooting them definitely helps.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.
4. If you want to build the project, run `npm run build`.
